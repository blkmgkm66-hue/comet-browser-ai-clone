# Agentic Browser Automation Platform â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview and Goals

The Agentic Browser Automation Platform is a modular desktop browser built on Chromium/Electron that embeds a multi-model AI assistant and agentic automation engine. It enables users and developers to compose, run, and share automated browsing workflows that combine deterministic steps with reasoning-driven actions.

### Primary Design Goal: Extreme Ease of Use

This platform prioritizes **extreme ease-of-use** above all else. Every interaction, from basic browsing to advanced agent creation, must be intuitive for beginners while remaining powerful for experts. The interface should eliminate technical barriers and make AI automation accessible to non-technical users through visual, template-driven workflows.

### Goals

- Deliver a reliable Electron-based browser with modern navigation and isolation primitives
- Provide an integrated, multi-model AI assistant for reasoning, extraction, and action planning
- **Integrate web search seamlessly** through embedded search nodes and browser navigation capabilities
- Leverage best-in-class open-source libraries for agentic workflows, graph visualization, and workflow automation
- Offer a **drag-and-drop visual workflow builder** and marketplace for sharing automations and agents
- **Provide extensive template gallery** with prebuilt agents and customization options
- Ensure strong security via sandboxing, permissions, an API key vault, and auditability
- Build a sustainable ecosystem with a sandbox for testing and monetization options
- **Prioritize GraphRAG tool simplicity** for knowledge management workflows

### Non-Goals (MVP)

- Full mobile clients (focus on desktop: macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Server-side hosted browser farms (local-first with optional remote runners later)
- Custom development of workflow engines, graph databases, or visualization frameworks (leveraging open-source solutions instead)
