# Agentic Browser Automation Platform â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview and Goals
The Agentic Browser Automation Platform is a modular desktop browser built on Chromium/Electron that embeds a multi-model AI assistant and agentic automation engine. It enables users and developers to compose, run, and share automated browsing workflows that combine deterministic steps with reasoning-driven actions.

### Goals
- Deliver a reliable Electron-based browser with modern navigation and isolation primitives.
- Provide an integrated, multi-model AI assistant for reasoning, extraction, and action planning.
- Ship an agentic workflow engine that can record, edit, simulate, and execute tasks safely.
- Offer a visual workflow builder and marketplace for sharing automations and agents.
- Ensure strong security via sandboxing, permissions, an API key vault, and auditability.
- Build a sustainable ecosystem with a sandbox for testing and monetization options.

### Non-Goals (MVP)
- Full mobile clients (focus on desktop: macOS, Windows, Linux).
- Server-side hosted browser farms (local-first with optional remote runners later).

## 2. Electron Browser Shell - Core Foundation

### 2.1 Architecture Overview
The Electron browser shell serves as the foundational layer of our agentic platform, providing a secure, performant, and extensible browser environment that integrates seamlessly with AI automation capabilities.

### 2.2 Key Components

#### Browser Core
- **Multi-tab Interface**: Standard tabbed browsing with isolated contexts per tab
- **Navigation Controls**: Back/forward/reload buttons, address bar with search integration
- **Download Manager**: Secure file download handling with sandboxed storage
- **Bookmark System**: Local bookmark storage with import/export capabilities

#### Security & Isolation
- **Process Isolation**: Each tab runs in its own renderer process for security and stability
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation to prevent XSS and code injection
- **Sandboxed Webviews**: Isolated webview containers with configurable permissions
- **Site Permissions**: Granular permission system for camera, microphone, location, etc.

#### AI Integration Points
- **DOM Access Layer**: Secure bridge for AI agents to interact with page content
- **Context Extraction**: Real-time page analysis for AI assistant context
- **Action Recording**: User interaction capture for workflow automation
- **Screenshot API**: Automated screenshot capture for visual AI processing

#### Development & Testing
- **DevTools Integration**: Built-in Chrome DevTools for debugging and inspection
- **Automation Bridge**: Playwright/Puppeteer-compatible API for programmatic control
- **Hot Reload**: Development mode with live code updates
- **Error Reporting**: Comprehensive error logging and crash reporting

### 2.3 Technical Specifications

#### Performance Requirements
- **Memory Usage**: Target <500MB baseline memory footprint
- **Startup Time**: <3 seconds cold start on modern hardware
- **Tab Switching**: <100ms tab switch latency
- **Page Load**: No significant overhead vs. standard Chromium

#### Platform Support
- **Primary**: macOS 10.15+, Windows 10+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- **Architecture**: x64 and ARM64 support
- **Auto-updater**: Built-in update mechanism with signature verification

#### Browser Engine
- **Base**: Latest stable Chromium via Electron
- **JavaScript Engine**: V8 with modern ES2023 features
- **Rendering**: Blink rendering engine with hardware acceleration
- **Network Stack**: Chromium network stack with custom proxy support

### 2.4 Implementation Clarifications

#### From Previous Discussions:
1. **Webview Isolation**: Each tab uses Electron's `webview` tag with `nodeintegration=false` and `contextisolation=true`
2. **IPC Security**: All communication between main process and renderers uses contextBridge API
3. **Extension Support**: Limited extension API for AI agents, not full Chrome extension compatibility
4. **Resource Management**: Automatic tab suspension for memory optimization
5. **Crash Recovery**: Tab-level crash recovery without affecting other tabs or main process

#### Security Hardening
- **CSP Headers**: Enforce strict Content-Security-Policy on all internal pages
- **Remote Module**: Completely disabled in all renderer processes
- **Node Integration**: Disabled in webviews, enabled only in main process
- **Context Isolation**: Mandatory for all renderer processes
- **Secure Defaults**: All file:// and chrome:// protocols restricted by default

### 2.5 Development Methodology & Documentation

**Project Documentation Standards**: As we develop this platform, we will maintain comprehensive documentation practices to ensure code quality and knowledge transfer:

- **Milestone Tracking**: Each development milestone will be documented in the README.md with completion status, key learnings, and blockers resolved
- **Code Annotations**: All significant code changes will include inline documentation explaining design decisions and implementation rationale  
- **Test Documentation**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests will include descriptive comments explaining test scenarios and expected behaviors
- **API Documentation**: All public APIs and internal interfaces will maintain up-to-date JSDoc documentation
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Major architectural decisions will be recorded with context, alternatives considered, and rationale for chosen approach
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance tests and benchmarks will be documented with baseline measurements and regression detection
- **Security Reviews**: Security considerations and threat model analysis will be documented for each major component

**Best Practices Commitment**: This documentation-first approach ensures maintainability, enables effective team collaboration, and provides clear audit trails for all development decisions. Future milestones, tests, and code explanations will be systematically recorded to maintain project quality and facilitate onboarding of new contributors.
