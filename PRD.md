# Agentic Browser Automation Platform — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview and Goals

The Agentic Browser Automation Platform is a modular desktop browser built on Chromium/Electron that embeds a multi-model AI assistant and agentic automation engine. It enables users and developers to compose, run, and share automated browsing workflows that combine deterministic steps with reasoning-driven actions.

### Goals
- Deliver a reliable Electron-based browser with modern navigation and isolation primitives.
- Provide an integrated, multi-model AI assistant for reasoning, extraction, and action planning.
- Leverage best-in-class open-source libraries for agentic workflows, graph visualization, and workflow automation.
- Offer a visual workflow builder and marketplace for sharing automations and agents.
- Ensure strong security via sandboxing, permissions, an API key vault, and auditability.
- Build a sustainable ecosystem with a sandbox for testing and monetization options.

### Non-Goals (MVP)
- Full mobile clients (focus on desktop: macOS, Windows, Linux).
- Server-side hosted browser farms (local-first with optional remote runners later).
- Custom development of workflow engines, graph databases, or visualization frameworks (leveraging open-source solutions instead).
