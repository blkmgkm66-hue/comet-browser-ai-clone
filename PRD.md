### 3.4 Glassmorphism and Elevation
- Apply translucent panels for floating UI (assistant panel, command palette, toasts):
  - background: var(--glass); backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(120%)
  - border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)

### 3.7 Motion and Animation
- Easing: var(--ease-out) cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) for entrances; var(--ease-smooth) cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- Durations: micro 120ms, fast 180ms, standard 240ms, deliberate 320ms
- Prefer transform-based GPU animations: translateX/Y, scale, opacity; avoid layout thrash
- Reduce motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion, cutting durations by 60% and removing parallax/glow pulses

## 4. Component Layout and Behaviors (Comet-Parity)

### 4.1 Left Navigation Bar
- Width: 72px collapsed (icons only), 240px expanded (icons + labels)
- Behavior: hover peek (desktop) expands to 240px while hovered; click pin to persist
- Animation: translateX + width transition 240ms var(--ease-smooth); elevation --sh-panel-md; glass on expanded
- Contents: top primary nav; bottom cluster with Settings, Help, Profile; active item has accent indicator bar (2px) and glow
- Keyboard: Alt+1..9 jump to primary; Ctrl/Cmd+B toggles collapse

### 4.2 Right Assistant Panel
- Default width 420px (min 320, max 600); resizable with drag handle at left edge
- Slide-in from right using 280ms var(--ease-smooth); shadow --sh-panel-lg; glass background
- Header: title, model/agent selector, minimize, close
- Body: messages with bubble grouping, timestamp on hover, code blocks in mono
- Input: sticky composer with attachments, suggestions chips, and Shift+Enter newline
- Context mode: when an agent is active, header adopts agent color slot and shows status

### 4.3 Bottom Agent Catalog Bar
- Height: 84px desktop, 72px tablet, 64px mobile
- Layout: two segments with vertical divider; Local (left, min 6), API (right, min 10)
- Cards: 56x56 icon circle with subtle inner shadow; label below on hover/tooltip
- Interaction: click to quick-launch; right-click opens context menu (pin, settings, docs)
- Scrolling: horizontal with snap; mouse wheel shift + scroll; touch swipe
- Drag-and-drop: reorder within segment; dragging shows placeholder and ghost preview

### 4.4 Content Area
- Uses remaining viewport; min width 320px; max content width 1440px with centered gutters
- Breadcrumb header with page title and quick actions; sticky at 56px height
- Panels/cards grid uses 12-column responsive grid with 24px gutters (16px tablet, 12px mobile)

### 4.5 Header/Toolbar
- Top bar height 56px; left area has hamburger (toggles nav), center search, right actions
- Command palette opens with Ctrl/Cmd+K as glass panel centered width 640px

---

## 5. Mobile and Responsive Behavior
- Breakpoints: sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536
- Left nav becomes off-canvas drawer on < md; swipe from left edge to open; body locks scroll when open
- Assistant panel becomes full-screen overlay on < md with dim backdrop; close on swipe right
- Agent bar condenses to a swipeable strip with 48px icons; segments accessible via tabs
- Reduce shadows and blurs on low-end devices; cap blur at 8px on mobile for perf

---

## 6. Accessibility
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 for text; 3:1 for large text and UI controls
- Focus visible: 2px accent ring or offset outline; never rely on color alone
- Keyboard complete: all nav and agent actions operable via keyboard
- Screen reader: aria-expanded, aria-current, role tabs, and live regions for assistant updates

---

## 7. Implementation Notes
- Centralize tokens in CSS variables and Tailwind theme; expose JS token map
- Create layout shell with CSS grid: [nav][content][assistant] with grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto
- Use ResizeObserver for assistant panel; store sizes and collapsed state in localStorage
- Framer Motion or CSS transitions for slide/peek; prefers-reduced-motion support
- Virtualize long agent lists; lazy-load icons; prefetch agent manifests on idle

Implementation Priority: Focus on establishing the new Comet-style architecture first (navigation bar, assistant panel, agent catalog bar) before adding complex agent logic. The new layout provides the foundation for scalable agent management and superior user experience.

Commit Message: Implement Comet-style layout with left navigation, right assistant panel, bottom agent catalog (6+ local, 10+ API agents), modal configuration system, minimalist design, and improved UX architecture.
