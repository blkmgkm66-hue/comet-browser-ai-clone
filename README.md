### 🆕 Prebuilt Agent System (Milestone 2)

#### Overview
A comprehensive agent system that provides prebuilt automation agents with tier-based AI capabilities:

#### Available Agents
1. **🌐 Web Scraper** - Extract structured data from websites
2. **📊 Data Analyzer** - Analyze and visualize data patterns
3. **📝 Content Summarizer** - Summarize articles and documents
4. **🔍 Research Assistant** - Help with research and fact-checking

#### Features

**Tier-Based Feature Gating:**
- **Tier 1 (Free)**: Access to local-only agents, AI mode locked with upsell messaging
- **Tier 2 (Upgraded)**: Full AI-enabled agents with platform API keys
- **Tier 3 (Premium)**: All Tier 2 features + ability to use your own API keys

**AI Model Providers:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Claude (Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet)
- Perplexity (Perplexity AI)

**Backend API Routing:**
- Tiers 1 & 2: Secure routing through platform API keys
- Tier 3: Direct API access with user-provided keys
- Rate limiting per tier (10/100/1000 requests per hour)
- Usage tracking and analytics

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing Milestone 2 Features

#### Quick Start Testing:

1. **Launch the application**: `npm start`
2. **Open Agent Menu**: Click the "🤖 Agents" button in the navigation bar
3. **Test Tier Switching**: Use keyboard shortcuts to switch tiers:
   - `Ctrl+1` = Free Tier (AI mode locked)
   - `Ctrl+2` = Upgraded Tier (AI mode enabled)
   - `Ctrl+3` = Premium Tier (AI mode + custom API keys)

#### User Testing Flow:

**Test Case 1: Free Tier (Tier 1)**
1. Press `Ctrl+1` to set Free tier
2. Open Agent Menu (🤖 Agents button)
3. Select any agent (e.g., Web Scraper)
4. Observe: "Make Smarter" toggle is visible but locked 🔒
5. Click the locked toggle: Should see upsell message
6. Click "Upgrade Now" button: Should display upgrade modal
7. Expected: Agent can still be started in "local" mode

**Test Case 2: Upgraded Tier (Tier 2)**
1. Press `Ctrl+2` to set Upgraded tier
2. Open Agent Menu
3. Select any agent
4. Observe: "Make Smarter" toggle is now enabled (unlocked)
5. Enable the toggle: Model provider section should appear
6. Select a model provider (OpenAI, Claude, or Perplexity)
7. Note: "Using platform API keys" message displayed
8. Click "Start Agent": Agent starts in "smart" mode
9. Check debug panel: Shows API routing configuration

**Test Case 3: Premium Tier (Tier 3)**
1. Press `Ctrl+3` to set Premium tier
2. Open Agent Menu
3. Select any agent
4. Enable "Make Smarter" toggle
5. Select a model provider
6. Observe: Additional "Use Your Own API Key" section appears
7. Enter a test API key (e.g., "test-key-123")
8. Click "Save Key": Should see confirmation
9. Click "Start Agent": Agent starts with user key configuration
10. Check debug panel: Shows user key is being used

#### Visual Validation Checklist:

- ✅ Agent cards display with icons, names, and descriptions
- ✅ Toggle switch animations work smoothly
- ✅ Lock icon (🔒) appears in Free tier
- ✅ Upsell message has gradient background in Free tier
- ✅ Model provider cards are selectable with radio buttons
- ✅ API key input field only visible in Premium tier
- ✅ Debug panel shows correct configuration JSON
- ✅ Tier indicator updates in status bar
- ✅ Responsive design works on smaller windows

#### Backend Integration Notes:

The `modelRouter.js` provides the foundation for backend API routing:

```javascript
// Example backend integration (Express.js)
const { createModelRouterMiddleware } = require('./src/api/modelRouter');
const middleware = createModelRouterMiddleware();

// Routes
app.post('/api/proxy/:provider', middleware.proxyRequest);
app.post('/api/direct/:provider', middleware.directRequest);
app.get('/api/usage', middleware.getUsage);
```

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key
```

#### Engineering Notes:

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Modular design: Agent config, UI, and routing are separate concerns
- Tier system enforced at multiple levels (UI, frontend validation, backend)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and manages costs
- User API keys stored securely (encrypted in production)

**Security Considerations:**
- Platform API keys never exposed to client
- User API keys encrypted at rest
- Rate limiting per user and tier
- Input validation on all API requests

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Lazy loading of agent configurations
- Debounced API requests
- Caching of frequently used model responses
- Efficient state management in UI

**Future Enhancements (Post-Milestone 2):**
- [ ] Custom agent creation
- [ ] Agent workflow chaining
- [ ] Voice input for agents
- [ ] Agent marketplace
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] A/B testing framework for agents

**[2025-10-13] TEST SUCCESS: Multi-tab browsing and session restore work as confirmed by Google and Netflix search/navigation. Passed end-user QA. Proceeded to Milestone 2 (AI Assistant/Agent System).**

**[2025-10-13] MILESTONE 1: Initial multi-tab browsing and session restore completed. See renderer.js for full implementation and notated progress.**

**[2025-10-12] MILESTONE: Refactored shutdown logic in main.js to keep browser app running on all platforms unless explicitly exited. App now recreates the main window to maintain browser experience instead of quitting. Notated code with milestone and TODOs for future tab recovery.**

**[2025-10-12] MILESTONE: Added comprehensive comments, MILESTONE markers, and TODO tags to renderer.js. Code now clearly marks completed features, outlines improvement areas (AI API integration, tab/session recovery), and improves maintainability for further agentic enhancements.**

**[2025-10-12] MILESTONE: Prototyped basic tab management UI in index.html and renderer.js. New Tab and Close Tab button controls and tab list display scaffolding added and commented. Tab logic & session restore are next.**
