# Ready Robot - Comet Browser AI Clone
A sophisticated desktop browser with integrated AI assistant capabilities, built on Electron.

## ✅ Milestone: Functional browser + AI assistant panel, basic NL navigation
Date: October 16, 2025

### What’s included in this milestone
- Browser main view is fully functional:
  - Address bar loads the main webview/iframe
  - Back/Forward/Refresh buttons wired with safe fallbacks
  - Active tab/page switching hooks (single-tab active state)
- Assistant panel toggle is robust:
  - Uses `open` class plus display/aria attributes to show/hide
  - Starts hidden but mounted; toggle and close button supported
- Minimal AI command interpreter:
  - In assistant chat, typing: `Go to <url>` will navigate the browser to that URL
  - URL normalization supports raw domains and search fallback
- Inline stubs for future AI-agent behaviors:
  - DOM click, scraping, multi-step plans, session/history persistence, and tool use

### How to test
1) Launch the app, ensure the assistant panel toggle shows/hides the sidebar properly.
2) Enter a URL in the address bar and press Go/Enter — the main view should load the page.
3) Use Back/Forward/Refresh — navigation should work or fallback gracefully.
4) Open the assistant, type: `Go to example.com` and press Send — browser should navigate.

### Notes
- Implemented in src/scripts/renderer.js
- Focus shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl+L to focus the address bar
- Webview events are handled if available (Electron); iframe fallback logic is included
