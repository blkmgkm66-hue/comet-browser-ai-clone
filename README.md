# Ready Robot - Comet Browser AI Clone

A sophisticated desktop browser with integrated AI assistant capabilities, built on Electron. This project creates a Perplexity Comet-inspired browser interface featuring intelligent navigation, automated agents, and seamless AI integration.

## âœ… Phase 1 Milestone: Scaffold Code Complete

**Status**: Completed on October 14, 2025

### Deliverables

Phase 1 Week 2 scaffold code has been successfully created with all components commented out as per PRD requirements:

#### 1. Electron App Shell (`main.js`)
- âœ… Basic Electron window configuration
- âœ… IPC communication handlers (commented scaffold)
- âœ… Enhanced window management setup
- âœ… Session management configuration
- âœ… Application lifecycle handlers

#### 2. Tailwind CSS Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)
- âœ… Custom color palette for Comet Browser theme
- âœ… Spacing configuration for three-panel layout
- âœ… Custom animations and transitions
- âœ… Z-index layering system
- âœ… Typography and font configuration
- âœ… Dark mode support with class-based toggling
- âœ… Plugin configuration (forms, typography, scrollbar)

#### 3. Component CSS Scaffold (`src/styles/phase1-components.css`)
- âœ… Modal system with overlay and animations
- âœ… Navigation components (address bar, nav buttons, tab bar)
- âœ… Sidebar navigation styles
- âœ… Three-panel layout structure
- âœ… Panel resizer for adjustable layout
- âœ… Dark mode CSS variable overrides

#### 4. Three-Panel Layout (`src/index.html`)
- âœ… Existing implementation already includes working three-panel layout
- âœ… Sidebar, main browser view, and assistant panel structure
- âœ… Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Next Steps

All Phase 1 scaffold code is commented out and ready for implementation. The next phase will involve:
1. Uncommenting and activating scaffold code
2. Testing each component individually
3. Integration testing across all components
4. Bug fixes and refinements

**Note**: All commented scaffold code includes milestone headers and detailed inline documentation for easy reference during implementation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Vision**: Create an intelligent desktop browser that combines traditional web browsing with AI-powered automation through a collection of specialized agents and assistants.

**Core Features**:
- Clean, minimalist three-panel interface
- Integrated AI chat assistant (right panel)
- Agent marketplace catalog (bottom panel)
- Traditional navigation with modern UX (left panel)
- Local and cloud-based AI agent ecosystem
- Workflow automation and customization

## ðŸ“‹ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

#### Week 1: Core Infrastructure

**Days 1-3: Project Setup**
- [ ] Initialize Electron project with Vite build system
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration and ESLint rules
- [ ] Create basic window management and app lifecycle
- [ ] Implement hot reload for development
- [ ] Set up automated testing with Jest and Playwright

**Open Source Libraries:**
- `electron` (latest LTS)
- `vite` for fast builds
- `typescript` for type safety
- `@electron/rebuild` for native dependencies
- `electron-builder` for packaging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Application launches with main window
- âœ… Hot reload works in development
- âœ… TypeScript compiles without errors
- âœ… Basic menu structure exists

**Days 4-7: Layout Foundation**
- [ ] Create three-panel layout (navigation, content, assistant)
- [ ] Implement responsive panel resizing with splitters
- [ ] Add basic routing system for navigation
- [ ] Set up CSS architecture with design tokens
- [ ] Create base component library

**Custom Build Requirements:**
- Panel splitter component with drag handles
- CSS custom properties system for theming
- Component registration system
- Route management without full framework

**Testing Steps:**
1. Verify panels resize correctly
2. Test routing between different views
3. Confirm responsive behavior at different window sizes
